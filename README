Authcard::SDI - authentication using SecurID/ACE cards

Copyright (c) 1998 Nigel Metheringham. All rights reserved.
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the same terms as Perl itself.

Requires at least client licenses and support libraries for SecurID.
All this was implemented and tested against the 1.3 client/server
base.

Check Makefile.PL before building - the build process needs to be told 
where the ace directory and libraries are.

Basically this module exposes the SecurID API into perl.  You can use
it pretty much exactly as the C API.  Documentation is in the main module.

There is some example code in examples that shows basic use of the
functionality, including next code and pin functionality.

The basic test functionality pretty much tests that it has compiled
and linked OK.  To test the thing properly you need to have it check
values - which I cannot do automatically.  Use the example code for
this.

If you are trying to use this code within a CGI script or similar, be
aware that the SecurID system holds a lot of state, and so you cannot
do a check() in one session and the do the next() or pin() calls in
another session - and I have not found a way of saving the state and
reloading it again.  I am also unconvinced that the underlying
libraries are thread safe or even safe to have multiple objects active 
at once (ie they use static storage someplace).

Please note that this is not supported, although I will look at
maintaining it on a best efforts basis.
